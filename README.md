# Capstone-Project-Creidt-Card-Fraud-Analytics
Suppose you are part of the analytics team working on a fraud detection model and its cost-benefit analysis. 
You need to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions based on the historical transactional data of customers with a pool of merchants. 
You can learn more about transactional data. You may find this helpful in the capstone project while building the fraud detection model. Based on your understanding of the model, you have to analyse the business impact of these fraudulent transactions and recommend the optimal ways that the bank can adopt to mitigate the fraud risks.
